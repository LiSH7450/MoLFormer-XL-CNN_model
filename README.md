## Introduction
In this study, we employ MoLFormer-XL [33], a pre-trained model trained on large-scale molecular datasets, to encode molecules. This is coupled with convolutional neural networks (CNN) to predict the risk of drug-induced QT prolongation (DIQT), drug-induced teratogenicity (DIT), and drug-induced rhabdomyolysis (DIR).
